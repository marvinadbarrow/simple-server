              This is a simple website built as the front end on a Node JS server, deployed on the Render platform. I initially wanted to learn Node JS because I was building a shopping list application and, wanting to be able to save user created categories and products for the app by writing the user data to JSON files, I learned that this couldn't be done with vanilla JS and I needed to use Node JS.</p>
              <p  class="about-para">
              In the end I decided to use indexedDB to do those tasks as it seemed a more appropriate solution (at least at the time).  But before I decided that, I went about learning the basics of Node JS. I didn't just want to copy tutorials without understanding the processes.  After deciding to use indexedDB for my app instead, I thought I should just continue learning what I could of Node and so I kept going.  I didn't want the knowledge to go to waste.</p>
              <p  class="about-para">
              This simple website is the result.  I also incorporated this knowledge into the shopping application which was originally just a front end app.  So now I have an alternative shopping app working with Node JS; that app is deployed to the 'Cyclic' platform. <br><br> 

              Here's a link to the shopping application:
